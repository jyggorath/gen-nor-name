# Generate random Norwegian name

## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Setup venv (use `.env` or `.venv`, they're in `.gitignore` already)
3. On regular basis, run using run script or alias in order to run as the venv. Optionally, edit the shebang to _not_ use venv, and install the requirements globally

## How to use?
Run `gen-nor-name.py -h`
